I stole this from Bon Appetit. Super delicious, comforting, very forgiving, with a silky texture that is unlike other pasta recipes I've made (probably due to the crushed chickpeas).

1. Dice onion, garlic. Rinse (well) and Drain Chick Peas.
2. Saute Onion in large saucepan until translucent (about 10 minutes). While Onions are cooking, crush canned tomatoes by hand. 
3. Add Garlic and let cook for 2-3 minutes (just starting to brown).
4. Add Chickpeas, rosemary and pepper flakes. Let cook for a minute or so, enough for the chickpeas to start to cook. Crush about 1/3 of the chickpeas against the side of the pot.
5. Add the crushed tomatos and let them cook down.
6. Once they've cooked down, add about 4 cups of water. Add the Pasta to the pot as well. Let it cook for 13 ish mintues or so. Add some salt. Let it cook down and the pasta will cook too. You can also fish out the rosemary stem
7. Once the pasta is cooked, remove from heat. Add the parmesan or pecorino gradually, making sure that the cheese doesn't clump.
8. Serve!

## My notes
1. I am not a big fan of the big rosemary leaves hiding in the pasta. I think it might be worth it to try adding the rosemary after adding the crushed tomatoes and/or fishing them out much earlier to try to catch some of them.
2. I think it'd be pretty cool to add some crispy chickpeas at the end. Kind of like little chickpea croutons.
3. I often serve this with a dollop of high quality ricotta, drizzled with good olive oil and add some coarse salt on the ricotta. Adds some creaminess that amplifies the silkiness of the starchy broth/sauce.
