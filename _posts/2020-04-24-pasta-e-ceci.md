1. Dice onion, garlic. Rinse (well) and Drain Chick Peas.
2. Saute Onion in large saucepan until translucent (about 10 minutes). While Onions are cooking, crush canned tomatoes by hand. 
3. Add Garlic and let cook for 2-3 minutes (just starting to brown).
4. Add Chickpeas, rosemary and pepper flakes. Let cook for a minute or so, enough for the chickpeas to start to cook. Crush about 1/3 of the chickpeas against the side of the pot.
5. Add the crushed tomatos and let them cook down.
6. Once they've cooked down, add about 4 cups of water. Add the Pasta to the pot as well. Let it cook for 13 ish mintues or so. Add some salt. Let it cook down and the pasta will cook too. You can also fish out the rosemary stem
7. Once the pasta is cooked, remove from heat. Add the parmesan or pecorino gradually, making sure that the cheese doesn't clump.
8. Serve!
