Jacque P√©pin's Chili con Carne minus the carne. This recipe's almost comically easy.

1. Blitz the mushrooms in a food processor and throw them in the Instant pot on saut√© mode. Cook out all the liquid from the mushrooms.
2. While the mushrooms are cooking out, dice the onion (you can just throw it in the same food processor), garlic and jalapeno. Peel and cut the carrots
3. Once the mushrooms are done, throw the onions in there with some olive oil. Let them cook out for a little (3 mins or so)
4. Now just throw the rest of the ingredients in the pot, stir, and cook in the instant pot on high pressure mode for 20 minutes.
5. Once the 20 mins are done, let it release on low pressure - see notes from here

## My notes
1. At the end, if it's too watery, try cooking it down a bit more on saute mode. You can also use an immersion blender to blend some of the beans to make it richer
2. Play around with the spice amounts. these are mostly guidelines.

## Footnotes
1. You can watch Jacques here: https://youtu.be/G3XYQ6jCRRU?t=248, but since I made it vegetarian, it's not quite the same.
