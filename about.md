I'm Prashanth, welcome to my site. . I try to blog about a bunch of things, but go through large gaps of time not writing anything. I also use this site to keep recipe notes of things I've cooked in the past.

Opinions are my own and don't reflect those of my employer
#### Who am I?

I'm... an engineer? Engineering Manager? Truthfully I don't really like to say I'm an X or a Y title or job. I love to build things, but more generally I like to understand problems, and hopefully solve them â€“ whether they're business, technical, product, strategy or whatever. 


I'm currently working at FullStory since late 2019, focused mostly on our mobile offering - currently managing a team, and also doing some engineering/coding/IC work. 

I've been interested in startups for the last 12 years or so, and working at startups for the last 9. 

#### Some philosophies (that will hopefully become blog posts)

1) Understanding is not binary, and not linear

2) Make things, and then make them better

3) You can still be rude while "being nice"

#### Chief Questions Officer? 

A bit of an inside joke, it's a self-bestowed title I gave myself. I became known as the person who asks questions at our various all hands meetings, and eventually it kind of stuck. I've been told by people in my life that I ask too many questions (lovingly of course!), which I can't really deny. What can I say, I like to understand why things are the way they are, why we are making certain decisions, and how I can help make things better. Which results in me asking way too many questions. Eventually I decided to own it and made it my title in slack @ FS and it stuck ever since.

(I just want to make it clear that it's a joke title! Please don't read it like I think very highly of myself that I needed a title, or anything like that)
